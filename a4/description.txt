Conclusion--

The conclusion I made from my analysis is that  network analysis provides insights into social media that can help individuals and 
organizations make informed decisions about online conversations. We can analyze the sentiments of people like political candidate team can do the analysis
by seeing the sentiments in twitter. Also community detection plays an important role in analysis, like what group of people have same attributes, same likes
dislikes and so on.

Network maps can reveal the structures of the crowd and highlight strategic locations or roles in these webs of connection. 
By mapping we can learn about the most common and best uses for these communication services.
Additionally, we can analyze the “natural” structure of a conversation around their core topics could profit from adjustment. 
For example, a brand may want to cultivate community, or an in-group might want to open up to outsiders. Using these maps, 
participants can assess the type of social media network in which they participate and set a target for what they want their group to be like.
